# Scala

Here you can find two files about Scala.

The first one named "First_Worksheet", is an introduction to the programming language: Scala.    
You'll find in it the basics of Scala: how to make basic operations, how to declare variables, lists, functions, etc.    
Note for example that if you decalre a variable with "var", you'll be able to change the value of this variable (besides lists). 
But in Sacala, we mostly use imutable variables so we create them with "val".    
The comments are in French but do not hesitate to try the code to see what it does and manipulate it. 

The second file "Exercices_Scala" is a serie of quite simple exercises to start manipulating strings, make some operations, etc., in Scala.  

I used Intellij IDEA community Edition wich is an optimal IDE to start coding in Scala and is very easy to install.
